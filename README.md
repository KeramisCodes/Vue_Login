# Vue_Login
This is a project I am working on as I learn Vue.js and Sass.
As a mom I am constantly making note of my families health, scheduling appointments, and 
filing medical records. 
Though this application is currently just a registration form, my goal is to create an app that 
will hold all this information for the user. 

Current Features:
* Registration Form

Future Features:
* Allow user to mark appointments on calendar
* Allow user to enter notes/reminders regarding health concerns etc.
* Allow user to input medical data to record dates and medications/vaccinations
* Apply filter component to allow user to search records by date
